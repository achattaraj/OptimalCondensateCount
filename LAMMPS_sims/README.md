* __Biased_first_traj__ and __Biased_second_traj__ contain input files to run __metadynamics simulations__ that bring cytosolic molecules near the membrane. __"FromMemDist.colvars"__ is the configuration file that specifies the order parameter (or collective variable).
* First_traj starts with uniformly distributed initial configuration (IC_Neph80.data) and runs for 250 million timesteps. Second_traj starts with the last timeframe from first_traj (final_state_Run*_Neph80_Ens05.restart) and again runs for 250 million steps.
* __Unbiased_traj__ contains input files for __standard Langevin Dynamics (without bias)__ that start with the last snapshots from "Biased_second_traj" simulations (final_state_r*_neph80_Ens05.restart). We compute the surface area and volume of the hemispherical cluster from these trajectories.
* __InitialCondition_setup__ contains files to specify the initial configuration of the system.
